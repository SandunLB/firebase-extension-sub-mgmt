# 🔒 Browser Extension Subscription System

This project offers a powerful yet straightforward subscription management system for browser extensions, combining **Firebase** for secure user authentication and **Stripe** for payment processing. It's designed to make adding paid subscription models to browser extensions smooth and reliable, enabling developers to focus on enhancing their app features.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🔑 Secure Authentication**: Using **Firebase Authentication**, users can securely sign up, log in, and manage their accounts. This supports popular authentication methods, such as email/password and Google sign-in, for a seamless user experience.
  
- **💳 Integrated Payment Processing**: With **Stripe**, this system manages all aspects of the payment flow, including initial subscriptions, renewals, and cancellations. Stripe ensures that user data is handled safely, allowing for credit card payments and flexible billing plans.

- **📊 Subscription Status Tracking**: **Firebase Firestore** is used to store and track user subscription statuses. This makes it easy for the extension to verify if a user has an active, canceled, or expired subscription in real-time.

- **💼 Automated Billing & Renewals**: Stripe’s automated billing takes care of recurring payments and manages subscription renewals, cancellations, and failed payment notifications. It keeps the system up-to-date, so the extension always knows the user’s current subscription state.

## 🗂️ How It Works

1. **User Authentication**: Users sign up or log in using Firebase Authentication. The secure setup supports various sign-in methods for flexibility and ease of access.
  
2. **Subscription Payment Flow**: Once authenticated, users select a subscription plan. Stripe processes their payment securely and handles the billing cycle, whether it's monthly, yearly, or custom.

3. **Subscription Management**: Firebase Firestore holds each user’s subscription status, updated through Stripe webhooks. This setup lets the extension confirm a user’s subscription status every time it’s accessed, ensuring they receive the appropriate access level.

4. **Automatic Renewal & Cancellation**: With Stripe’s built-in automation, subscriptions renew automatically according to the plan. Users are notified before renewals and can manage their subscription status, making the process user-friendly and low-maintenance.

## 📈 Advantages

- **Efficient Payments**: With Stripe handling the heavy lifting, payments are processed securely, freeing developers from creating custom billing solutions.
- **Seamless Subscription Tracking**: Firebase Firestore stores and updates user statuses, making access control effortless.
- **Scalability**: Firebase and Stripe handle large numbers of users, making this system perfect for extensions with both free and premium offerings.

## 🎉 Ready for Deployment

This system is ideal for any browser extension requiring gated access or premium features, allowing developers to monetize and manage subscriptions efficiently. Once set up, it’s ready for deployment and scaling, helping you start generating revenue from your extension with minimal effort.
